* Added analysis without patients who had acute CHF diagnisis prior or on the 1st AMI admission

### 05/05/2017
* In 'midas15_mi2hf_data.R/PART III' lines 644 to 657, replaced 'prior' with 
'(prior | current)' for histories of risk factors

### 04/08/2017 
* Updated data set to MIDAS15

### 02/05/2017
* Updated subset: using acute CHF admission (DX1 only) following AMI discharge (DX1 only)
* Finilazed the analysis

From Jen's email:    

Attached is the revised copy of the HF after MI paper. I took your advice and reworked some of the sections. The things that need improvement or additions from you are:

1. The statistical Analysis section: Just some more detailed explanation of what was done to come up with our results.

2. Table 1: I filled most of it out with the numbers you provided on the email from May 3rd but I'd also like to include p values for significance for each follow up period (30 days, 90 days 180 days, and 1 year). We did this for my presentation but I didn't do all the follow up periods. It'd be nice to see if the decrease over time was significant or not. (it was i think)

3. Table 2: If you don't mind adding this table with the odds ratios and confidence intervals, that'd be helpful. I only included the graph (figure 2) that includes patients without current or prior HF. This table will dictate in my discussion which risk factors ended up being significant - I think only DM and CKD were in the end.

In subsequent meetings I know various members of CVI have brought up to expand the risk factors and also look at subendocardial MI or STEMI but I would like to leave the analysis as is for now and finish the paper. We can add additional studies later on the future.

I'd like to make final changes at the end of the week and hopefully get it submitted soon! As soon as you send it to me I will make final changes; I'll also be here all week. I move this weekend to Philly but of course I can work on this remotely.
